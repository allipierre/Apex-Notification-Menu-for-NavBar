This dynamic action plugin allows to render a notification menu in Universal Theme 1.1 which gets its information through an SQL statement. It also has many configuration options and an automatic refresh (if desired). Unfortunately, it is only available with the Universal Theme 1.1 but Apex 5.1.1.1, because the CSS has to be adapted for older themes.
